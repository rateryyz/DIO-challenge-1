I completed the project challenge from DIO, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. I followed the guidelines provided, but I also made some updates to improve the overall responsiveness of the design.

One of the main challenges was ensuring that the project looks great on any screen size or resolution. To tackle this, I replaced all fixed measurements with percentages or rem units. This way, everything adjusts smoothly to fit different devices, making the user experience much better!

Feel free to check it out, and I hope you find it as interesting as I did while working on it!

Happy codin
